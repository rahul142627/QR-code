# QR-code
This project is a simple yet modern QR Code Generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to easily generate QR codes by entering any text or website name — the app automatically formats the input into a proper URL if needed (for example, typing “instagram” becomes “https://instagram.com”).

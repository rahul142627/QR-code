This project is a simple yet modern QR Code Generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to easily generate QR codes by entering any text or website name — the app automatically formats the input into a proper URL if needed (for example, typing “instagram” becomes “https://instagram.com”). The generated QR code is clickable, so users can test it immediately, and it can be downloaded as an image with a single click. The app also includes a dark mode toggle for better readability in low‑light environments. The project uses the lightweight qrcodejs library to create QR codes dynamically, making it a practical tool and a beginner‑friendly example of working with JavaScript DOM manipulation, external libraries, and responsive design.
